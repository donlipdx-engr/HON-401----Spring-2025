# HON-401----Spring-2025
Res: Deep Learning Algorithms

## Introduction

My name is Don Li, and I'm a student at Portland State University pursuing a BA in mathematics; I am also a member of the University Honors College (UHC) at Portland State. This project is part of my undergraduate research experience at Portland State through taking [HON 401](https://www.pdx.edu/honors/hon-401-research). My HON 401 research experience this term is focused on the algorithms that underlie neural networks, and I am doing this work under the supervision of [Prof. Dacian Daescu](https://web.pdx.edu/~daescu/). My research experience is centered on reading and reproducing the results of [Higham(2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05894). 

Here are the contents of the project:

1. Overview of Deep Learning and Neural Networks
2. Overview of Stochastic Gradient Descent and Backpropagation
3. Python Implementation of 4-Layer Neural Network for Binary Classification (Higham (2019))
4. A Primer on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's)
5. Python Implementation of 3-Layer Neural Network for Multi-Class Classification (Fisher's Iris Dataset)

This research project culminated in a final presentation, the slides for which are attached in the main branch of this repo. The abstract follows.

## Abstract

*This project is my work for Portland State University's University Honors College (UHC) research course, HON 401. Neural networks are the engine of the current AI boom. Given recent major advancements, we give an introductory overview of deep learning and neural networks, particularly for classification tasks. Moreover, we discuss stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, i.e., the key algorithms that underlie the training of a neural network, and discuss these algorithms from the standpoint of an optimization problem. We supplement the relevant theory with Python implementations of binary and multi-class classification neural networks.*
