Res: Deep Learning Algorithms

## Introduction

My name is Don Li, and I'm a student at Portland State University studying computer science and mathematics; I am also a member of the University Honors College (UHC) at Portland State. This project is part of my undergraduate research experience at Portland State through taking [HON 401](https://www.pdx.edu/honors/hon-401-research). My HON 401 research experience this term is focused on the algorithms that underlie neural networks, and I am doing this work under the supervision of [Prof. Dacian Daescu](https://web.pdx.edu/~daescu/). My research experience is centered on reading and reproducing the results of [Higham(2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05894).

## An Overview of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's)

In 1955, computer scientist John McCarthy [defined](https://hai-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf) artificial intelligence as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines". _Machine learning_ is a major subset of AI concerned with building AI models that can learn and make inferences from data. More precisely, machine learning is concerned with making predictions about a _target variable_ (i.e., the output of a model) using data from _feature variables_ (i.e., the inputs of a model). Machine learning models are concerned with either _regression_ tasks (i.e., predicting the value of a continuous variable) or _classification_ tasks (i.e., predicting a category that a data point belongs to).
