# HON-401----Spring-2025
Res: Deep Learning Algorithms

## Introduction

My name is Don Li, and I'm a student at Portland State University studying computer science and mathematics; I am also a member of the University Honors College (UHC) at Portland State. This project is part of my undergraduate research experience at Portland State through taking [HON 401](https://www.pdx.edu/honors/hon-401-research). My HON 401 research experience this term is focused on the algorithms that underlie neural networks, and I am doing this work under the supervision of [Prof. Dacian Daescu](https://web.pdx.edu/~daescu/). My research experience is centered on reading and reproducing the results of [Higham(2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05894).
